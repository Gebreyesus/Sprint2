Purpose:

"To use Agile/Scrum development to design and implement a working tool to provide students and advisors with information on major completion.
You may design this tool as you see fit to complete the project. You should, however, consider generalizability (donâ€™t just think about Augsburg,
think about how this tool could be generalized to work for ANY school)."
